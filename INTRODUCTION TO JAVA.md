# 🌟 Introduction to Java  

---

## 📜 History and Origin  
- Developed in **1991** by *James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton* at **Sun Microsystems** as part of the *Green Project*.  
- Initially designed for **interactive television**, later evolved into a **general-purpose programming language**.  
- Naming history:  
  - **Oak** → after an oak tree near Gosling’s office  
  - **Green**  
  - **Java** → named after *Java coffee* ☕  
- **First public release**: *Java 1.0* in **1996**.  
- Introduced the concept of **“Write Once, Run Anywhere” (WORA)** – compiled bytecode runs on any platform with a JVM.  
- **2006** → Released under the **GNU GPL (Open Source)**.  
- **2009** → Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems and took over Java’s stewardship.

## 🚀 Key Features of Java  
- **Platform Independence** 🖥️ → Compile once, run anywhere (JVM-based).  
- **Object-Oriented** 🔑 → Supports **encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism**.  
- **Simple & Familiar Syntax** ✨ → Similar to **C/C++** but with fewer complexities.  
- **Secure** 🔒 → Bytecode verifier + sandboxing prevents malicious code.  
- **Robust** 🛠️ → Strong memory management, exception handling, and type checking.  
- **Multithreaded** ⚡ → Supports concurrent execution with threads.  
- **Architecture-Neutral** 🌐 → Bytecode format is platform-independent.  
- **High Performance** 🚅 → **JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler** boosts execution speed.  
- **Distributed Computing** 🌍 → Ideal for network-centric applications.  
- **Dynamic** 🔄 → Supports runtime linking of new classes & libraries.

## 🏗️ Java Editions  
1. **Java Standard Edition (SE)** → Core language + libraries.  
2. **Java Enterprise Edition (EE)** → Enterprise-level, distributed, and web applications.  
3. **Java Micro Edition (ME)** → Mobile & embedded systems.
