# 🌟 Introduction to Java  

---

## 📜 History and Origin  
- Developed in **1991** by *James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton* at **Sun Microsystems** as part of the *Green Project*.  
- Initially designed for **interactive television**, later evolved into a **general-purpose programming language**.  
- Naming history:  
  - **Oak** → after an oak tree near Gosling’s office  
  - **Green**  
  - **Java** → named after *Java coffee* ☕  
- **First public release**: *Java 1.0* in **1996**.  
- Introduced the concept of **“Write Once, Run Anywhere” (WORA)** – compiled bytecode runs on any platform with a JVM.  
- **2006** → Released under the **GNU GPL (Open Source)**.  
- **2009** → Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems and took over Java’s stewardship.

- **Object-Oriented** 🔑 → Supports **encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism**.  
- **Simple & Familiar Syntax** ✨ → Similar to **C/C++** but with fewer complexities.  
- **Secure** 🔒 → Bytecode verifier + sandboxing prevents malicious code.  
- **Robust** 🛠️ → Strong memory management, exception handling, and type checking.  
- **Multithreaded** ⚡ → Supports concurrent execution with threads.  
- **Architecture-Neutral** 🌐 → Bytecode format is platform-independent.  
- **High Performance** 🚅 → **JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler** boosts execution speed.  
- **Distributed Computing** 🌍 → Ideal for network-centric applications.  
- **Dynamic** 🔄 → Supports runtime linking of new classes & libraries.

# 💡 Java Interview Questions & Answers (FAANG Level)

---

## 1. Why is Java called a platform-independent language?  
**Answer:**  
Java code is compiled into **bytecode**, an intermediate code that can run on any platform having a **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**.  
JVM interprets or compiles this bytecode at runtime specific to the platform, making Java **platform-independent**.  

---

## 2. What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?  

- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):** Runs Java bytecode on different platforms.  
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):** Contains JVM and standard libraries to run Java programs but no development tools.  
- **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Includes JRE + compiler and other tools for Java application development.  

---

## 3. Why is Java not considered a pure object-oriented language?  
**Answer:**  
Java supports **primitive types** (`int`, `boolean`, `char`, etc.) which are **not objects**.  
Pure OOP requires everything to be an object.  

---

## 4. Explain Stack vs Heap memory in Java.  

- **Stack Memory:**  
  - Stores method call frames, local variables, and references.  
  - Follows **LIFO order** and is **thread-specific**.  

- **Heap Memory:**  
  - Used for dynamic memory allocation of **objects and class instances**.  
  - **Shared across threads**.  
  - Garbage Collector frees unreferenced objects here.  

---

## 5. What is bytecode?  
**Answer:**  
Bytecode is the **intermediate, platform-independent code** generated by the Java compiler from source code.  
The JVM interprets or compiles bytecode into **machine code** to run on hardware.  

---

## 6. What are the main features of Java?  

- Platform Independent  
- Object-Oriented  
- Secure  
- Robust (memory management + exception handling)  
- Multithreaded  
- High Performance (JIT Compiler)  
- Dynamic and Distributed  

---
## 7. What is the importance of the main() method in Java?  
**Answer:**  
`main()` is the **entry point**. JVM calls this method to start program execution.  

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {}
```
## 8. Describe typecasting in Java. What are widening and narrowing conversions?  

**Typecasting:** Conversion from one data type to another.  

- **Widening (Implicit):** Smaller type → larger type (safe).  
  Example: `int → long`.  

- **Narrowing (Explicit):** Larger type → smaller type (requires explicit cast).  
  Example: `double → int`.  

```java
int i = 100;
long l = i;       // Widening
int j = (int) l;  // Narrowing
```

---

## 9. What are literals in Java?  

**Answer:**  
Literal values are **fixed values** assigned directly in source code.  

Examples:  
- **Integer literal** → `10`  
- **Floating-point literal** → `10.5`  
- **Character literal** → `'A'`  
- **String literal** → `"Hello"`  

---

## 10. Explain constructor and its types.  

- **Constructor:** A special method that **initializes new objects**.  

### Types:  
1. **Default Constructor** → No parameters, auto-provided if none defined.  
2. **Parameterized Constructor** → User-defined with parameters.  

```java
class Person {
    String name;
    Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

---

## 11. What is the difference between equals() and == operator?  

- **equals():** Compares **content/value equality** of objects.  
- **== operator:** Compares **reference equality** (whether both refer to the same object in memory).  

```java
String a = new String("test");
String b = new String("test");

System.out.println(a == b);      // false (different objects in memory)
System.out.println(a.equals(b)); // true (same content)
```

---

## 12. Explain method overloading and method overriding.  

### 🔹 Method Overloading  
- Same method name, but **different parameter lists**.  
- Achieves **compile-time polymorphism**.  

```java
void display(int a) { }
void display(String b) { }
```

---

## 🔹 Method Overriding  

- A **subclass provides a specific implementation** of a method already defined in its superclass.  
- Achieves **runtime polymorphism**.  

### ✅ Example:
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```
# 13. What are Packages in Java?  

**Answer:**  
Packages in Java are used to **group related classes and interfaces** together.  
They help in:  

- 📦 **Modular structure** → organize code into logical units  
- 🏷️ **Namespace management** → avoid class name conflicts  

---

### ✅ Example:

```java
package com.company.project;

import java.util.Scanner; // Importing a class from another package
```


# 14. What is String[] args in public static void main(String[] args)?

**Answer:**

String[] args in public static void main(String[] args) is simply an array of strings that stores command-line arguments passed to the program when it runs. It allows external input to be fed into the program at runtime.
